1. Random Color Generator - To make this project you should have a good knowledge about [Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events "mdn docs") in javscript and how to add events on elements like buttons for example using       addEventListner() method. Here i used one of the mouse event called click event .
  - An element receives a click event when a pointing device button (such as a mouse's primary mouse button) is both pressed and released        while the pointer is located inside the element.
  - Here you can learn more about [click event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event "mdn docs")

2. Todo List Application - To make this project you know Dom tree traversing , events in javascript like how to add events on elements.
   - Important concepts like :-
   - Event object
   - Event Bubbling
   - Event Capturing
   - Event delegation
  
   - These concepts make your work more easier instead of adding event listener to every element, just add the event on the parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property of the event object.
   - Event object - for example i added a click event on the button , the moment i clicked on the button , web apis of browser will send the callback function of the click event and event object( object containing the information of event in key-value pairs ) in the callback queue. Now event loop will check if the callstack is empty or not if it is empty  then it will take the callback function with event object and push it into the callstack for execution .
